### Phishing Attack Using Zphisher Tool

## Overview
This project demonstrates a phishing attack using the Zphisher tool on Kali Linux. The attack targets a victim by creating a fake login page that mimics a popular website, capturing the user's credentials when they attempt to log in. **This project is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized phishing attacks are illegal and unethical. Always obtain proper authorization before conducting any form of penetration testing.**

## Tools Used
- **Zphisher**: An automated phishing tool that supports various platforms.
- **Kali Linux**: A Debian-based Linux distribution used for penetration testing and security research.
- **Ngrok/Serveo**: Services to expose the phishing page to the internet.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Kali Linux installed on your machine.
- Git installed on Kali Linux.

### Steps to Install Zphisher
1. **Update your system**:
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

2. **Clone the Zphisher repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher.git

3. **Navigate to the Zphisher directory**:
   cd zphisher

4. **Give execution permissions**:

## How to Perform the Phishing Attack

### Step 1: Run Zphisher
1. **Start Zphisher**:

### Step 3: Deploy and Monitor
1. **Copy the phishing URL** generated by Ngrok or Serveo.
2. **Distribute the phishing URL** to the target (with permission).
3. **Monitor for login attempts** and view captured credentials in the Zphisher terminal.

### Step 4: Stop the Attack
1. **Terminate Zphisher**:
   - Stop the attack by closing the terminal window or pressing `CTRL + C`.
2. **Analyze the captured data**.
